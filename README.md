# Rummoli Simulator
Rummoli is a game that doesn't need to be played. After the player who starts the round has been chosen the rest of the round is pre-determined and doesn't require any thought or strategy by the player. This program simulates a game of Rummoli so that you don't have to play it. 

## Notes: 
- Rules for Rummoli as per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummoli#Play).
- 'Poker' round is not simulated - starting player is assigned randomly (playing a round of poker before each round is too much like an actual game!) 

## Known Issues and Bugs: 
1. Players should be eliminated from play once they run out of coins. Currently they're forced to play forever no matter how far into debt they go. 
2. The 7-8-9 pot does not pay out (it just keeps hoarding everyones coins like a dragon if the game goes on long enough.)
